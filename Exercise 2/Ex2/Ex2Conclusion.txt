We realised that the Greedy Algorithem selects the better features but its run time
is slower than the Mutual Information Algorithm's runtime meaning MI is faster than
the Greedy Algorithem but that doesnt mean it selects the better features and has higher
accuracy.
Overall the Better Accuray and better selecting features is from the Greedy Algorithem
but the better runtime is the MI's
